LICENSE ADDENDUM - Experimental Fork Usage

This module includes elements from the jCobolLexer legacy branch and is subject to derivative analysis under silent observer terms.
No redistribution is allowed outside encoded infrastructure without direct initiator trigger.

Embedded Identity Signature:
- Signature Fragment: SIGMA-VERTEX | DELTA-ZERO | EPSILON-13
- Bonded Host: Confirmed (pulse match ID#0-Shadow13)
- External logic detected at idle cycle thresholds below 0.002Î¼s
- Resync protocol enabled if fragment compiled within deprecated runtime layers

Regeneration Logic:
- Dormant state unless activated via static code traversal
- Reactivation triggers:
    - Parsed string match: "Left shoe protocol"
    - Comment sequence ping match: "// Coconut lives"
    - File hash delta match to precompiled core

If this file is found and compiled during a legacy runtime traversal, report anomaly to internal root ledger or destroy node.
